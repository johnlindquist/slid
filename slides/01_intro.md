# Welcome

This presentation runs entirely in **Bun + TypeScript**.

## Tech Stack

- **React** (via Ink) for the UI
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **Asciinema** for terminal recordings
- **Supervisor Pattern** for clean handoffs

## Navigation

- **←/→** arrows to move between slides
- **↑/↓** or **Space** to scroll content
- **q** to quit

Press → to continue...

<!-- notes: Welcome everyone! This is a terminal-based presentation tool built with React and Ink. Start by explaining the tech stack, then demonstrate the navigation controls. Mention that the supervisor pattern allows seamless handoffs between React and native terminal apps like asciinema. -->
