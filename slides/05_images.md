# Image Support

This slide demonstrates **image support** in the terminal slides app.

## Sample Image

Here is a sample image rendered directly in the terminal:

![Sample Photo](images/sample.jpg)

## How It Works

- Uses `terminal-image` library for rendering
- Supports iTerm2, Kitty, WezTerm, and other modern terminals
- Falls back to ANSI block characters on unsupported terminals
- Images are automatically scaled to fit the viewport

## Supported Formats

- **JPG** - Full support
- **GIF** - Static rendering (first frame)
