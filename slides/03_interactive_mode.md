# Interactive Mode

Start a full conversation using `ico` (or `copilot`).

## Starting a Session

Start an interactive session (using the `ico` alias):

```bash
ico
```

Start with a specific prompt:

```bash
ico "Help me refactor this codebase"
```

## Features

  - Slash commands
  - Message history
  - Clean messaging around tooling and permissions

## When to Use

  - Exploratory coding sessions
  - Tasks requiring back-and-forth discussion
  - Multiple file changes

<!-- notes: Interactive mode is the default experience. Use ico for a full session where you can have a conversation. The -i flag with a prompt starts interactive mode but immediately executes your prompt first. -->
